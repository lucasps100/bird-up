** See `GETTING_STARTED.md` to gte started. **

## 1. Problem Statement
These days, social media platforms tend to be hub of vanity, pretention and vitriol. While there are great sub-communities on most social existing platforms, they can be dificult to locate. Plus, social media platforms don't have domain-specific features as they are designed to support the widest range of communities. While this is a smart business move for a profit-maximizing corporation, the universality of these platforms comes at the cost of access to the most cutting edge domain-specific tools that are handcrafted with your community in mind. 

## 2. Technical Solution
Bird Up: a social media for bird watchers, with AI powered bird recognition, location specific species discovery, and platform for sharing and discussing your latest discoveries.
